# SudokuSolver
## Program for solving 9x9 Sudoku puzzles

Uses the "Simple" algorithm to solve the puzzle - Involves scanning each row, column and 3x3 subgrid of the sudoku
puzzle until finds the appropriate number to place in the unit square.

### The GUI is a work in progress
Currently the GUI is using code from [here](http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2013/10/guide-to-creating-sudoku-solver-using.html)
Will later implement own personal version of GUI.
